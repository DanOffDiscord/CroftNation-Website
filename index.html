					<h2 class="subtitle is-3">Hello there! Welcome to the Croft Nation website, the website for an amazing community of streamers and content creators.</h2>
					<br>
					<br>
					<h3 class="title is-2">Who are we?</h3>
					<p class="subtitle is-4">Croft Nation is a an amazing community of Twitch streamers and content creators!</p>
					<p class="subtitle is-4">In addition to an incredible Twitch community, we also have an active and friendly Discord community, where you can express your streaming tips/ask for help, and you'll almost certainly get a response from one of our Staff members/Stream Team members.</p>
					<br>
					<br>
					<h4 class="title is-2">But why not do this alone?</h4>
					<p class="subtitle is-4">Well, why do streaming alone and by yourself when you can use up all of the amazing power of hundreds of Twitch streamers to make one massive team?</p>
					<br>
					<br>
					<h5 class="title is-2">How do I go about joining this team?</h5>
					<p class="subtitle is-4">It's very easy, all you have to do is join the Croft Nation Discord here: <a href="https://discord.gg/Bf8yhB9">https://discord.gg/Bf8yhB9</a> (or you can click the Discord icon at the top, or the "Discord" text in the top right), then fill in this Google Form, which will be sent off to one of the Head Council members.</p>
					<p class="subtitle is-4">During this waiting time period, which could be up to 2 weeks, you'll be given the "Applicant" role. When you have this Applicant role, you are basically monitored by the higher ups at CroftNation, who will look at your activity as a general streamer, <strong style="color: white">and</strong> in the Discord server. A lot of people pressume you have to chat in the CroftNation server 24/7, but this is not the case, you being active could simply be saying "Hello everyone!" to people or "How's your day been?" to a member.</p>

I'd say out of those 5 months I been a member at Croft Nation for at least 4 and it has been a pleasure to be here! I quickly found out that the community is a ton of fun and super supportive of each other." - <a href="https://twitch.tv/johnthescavenger">John The Scavenger</a>

										"I remember joining back in November time from the stream of InfernoGamingx and made sooooo many memories!!! When I applied for jnr council when mods roles were becoming a thing, I did not expect to come this far up the chart!! When I needed a loving, caring, friendly community I've got one. Friends became family to me in such a short while!!! Many many thanks to JamieCroft who offered me a place on the staff family and here's to many more years!!! I have grown in confidence and made many many friends, and hopefully more to come!" - <a href="https://twitch.tv/iwantadirewolf">Dire</a>

										"Croft Nation has literally changed me as a person, I used to be really shy, self conscious, and nervous/awkward which is why I don't stream, because I just get anxious that it's gonna look shit, or be shit or something is gonna go wrong, but being a part of such an amazing community that are more like a family than anything else, and you guys are so supportive it's crazy. Thank you JamieCroft and Xandiarr for bringing us all together with this wonderful community, and thank you for not listening to whoever said it couldn't be done, because god damn you proved them wrong in a huge amazing way!" - <a href="https://twitch.tv/XcentriXTV">XcentriXTV</a>
